# aiCEO Hackathon Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Vision**: Democratize entrepreneurship by providing AI-powered C-suite agents to help anyone turn their ideas into sustainable businesses.

**Core Value Proposition**: Every person becomes a CEO with access to specialized AI agents (CTO, CMO, CFO, COO, COS) to build and scale their company.

## Development Strategy
**Phase 1**: Use Mastra's built-in playground for rapid agent development and testing
**Phase 2**: Build custom executive dashboard frontend for demo presentation
**Advantage**: Leverage Mastra's development tools while creating a polished user experience

## System Architecture & Data Flow

### Core Inputs & Outputs

**Primary Inputs**:
- Business idea description (text)
- CEO directives and feedback (via COS chat interface)
- Industry/market preferences
- Budget constraints and timeline requirements
- Strategic priorities and goals

**Primary Outputs**:
- Comprehensive business plan document
- Executive task list with clear actionable items
- OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) dashboard
- KPI tracking and projections
- Agent recommendations and analysis reports
- Strategic roadmap with milestones

### CEO ↔ COS Communication Flow
- **CEO Input**: Strategic direction, priorities, feedback, course corrections
- **COS Output**: Status updates, agent summaries, decision requests, task progress
- **Continuous Loop**: Real-time chat interface for ongoing guidance and alignment

### Agent Task Delegation Model
**Key Principle**: Agents analyze and plan, but create tasks for manual execution

**Task Creation Framework**:
- Each agent identifies required actions within their domain
- Tasks are clearly defined with:
  - Objective and success criteria
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Required resources/tools
  - Expected timeline
  - Dependencies on other tasks
- All tasks flow to a central task management system
- CEO can prioritize, modify, or delegate tasks

**Example Task Flows**:
- **CMO**: "Launch social media campaign" → Creates task: "Post the following tweet: [exact content] with hashtags #startup #innovation at 2pm EST for maximum engagement"
- **CTO**: "Set up development environment" → Creates task: "Install Node.js v18+, create GitHub repo with [specific name], initialize with React + TypeScript template"
- **CFO**: "Secure initial funding" → Creates task: "Contact investor [Name] at [Email] with attached pitch deck, schedule 30-min intro call"
