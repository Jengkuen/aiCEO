# AI CEO Agent Architecture - Corrected Delegation Model

## Architecture Overview

The AI CEO system implements a hierarchical C-suite agent structure with proper delegation and coordination. The Chief of Staff (COS) serves as the strategic orchestrator, creating company-level OKRs and delegating specialized work to domain experts.

## ✅ CORRECTED ARCHITECTURE (Updated)

### **Issue Identified and Resolved**
The initial implementation incorrectly positioned the COS as a detailed task executor rather than a strategic orchestrator. This has been corrected to reflect proper hierarchical C-suite delegation.

### **Problems Fixed:**
- ❌ COS was creating detailed operational tasks directly → ✅ COS now orchestrates and delegates
- ❌ Missing delegation framework → ✅ Comprehensive delegation tool created
- ❌ Flat structure instead of hierarchical → ✅ Proper COS → Specialist workflow

## Hierarchical Agent Structure

```
CEO (Human User)
└── COS (Chief of Staff) - Strategic Orchestrator
    ├── Creates: OKRs, Strategic Priorities, Delegation Plans
    ├── Tools: generate-okrs, create-delegation-plan
    ├── Delegates to:
    │   ├── CTO: Technology strategy & development tasks (35% budget)
    │   ├── CMO: Marketing strategy & brand development tasks (25% budget)
    │   ├── CFO: Financial planning & funding strategy tasks  
    │   └── COO: Operations & process optimization tasks (20% budget)
    └── Synthesizes: Unified business plan from specialist outputs
```

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Orchestrated Business Analysis (Primary Workflow)

#### **Phase 1: COS Strategic Assessment & OKR Creation**
1. **Business Analysis**: Evaluate idea viability, market opportunity, competitive landscape
2. **Strategic Priorities**: Identify 3-5 key focus areas requiring specialized expertise
3. **OKR Generation**: Use `generate-okrs` tool to create measurable company objectives
4. **Domain Mapping**: Determine which specialized agents to engage for detailed planning

```typescript
// COS creates company-level OKRs
const okrs = await cosAgent.tools['generate-okrs']({
  businessIdea: "Sustainable food delivery service...",
  businessContext: { industry: "Food delivery", budget: 500000 },
  strategicPriorities: ["Market Entry", "Technology Platform", "Brand Development"]
})
```

#### **Phase 2: COS Delegation to Specialists**
1. **Delegation Planning**: Use `create-delegation-plan` tool for comprehensive coordination
2. **Budget Allocation**: Distribute resources across domains (CTO: 35%, CMO: 25%, COO: 20%)
3. **Context Sharing**: Provide business background and domain-specific priorities
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Establish cross-agent coordination requirements

```typescript
// COS creates delegation plan for specialized agents
const delegationPlan = await cosAgent.tools['create-delegation-plan']({
  businessIdea: "Sustainable food delivery service...",
  businessContext: { industry: "Food delivery", budget: 500000 },
  strategicPriorities: ["Market Entry", "Technology Platform"],
  companyOKRs: okrs.objectives
})
```

#### **Phase 3: Specialist Task Creation** (Future Implementation)
Each specialist creates domain-specific tasks using their expertise:

```typescript
// CTO creates technology and development tasks
await ctoAgent.tools['generate-tasks']({
  agentType: 'CTO', // Domain-specific, not 'COS'
  businessContext: delegationPlan.ctoAssignment,
  // Creates: Technical architecture, development roadmap, infrastructure tasks
})

// CMO creates marketing and brand development tasks
await cmoAgent.tools['generate-tasks']({
  agentType: 'CMO',
  businessContext: delegationPlan.cmoAssignment,
  // Creates: Brand development, marketing campaigns, customer acquisition tasks
})
```

#### **Phase 4: COS Synthesis & Integration**
1. **Collect Domain Plans**: Gather detailed task plans from each specialized agent
2. **Integration Analysis**: Ensure cross-functional alignment and dependency management
3. **Resource Coordination**: Balance budget, timeline, and human resources across domains
4. **Strategic Synthesis**: Combine domain expertise into unified business plan
5. **CEO Communication**: Present integrated business plan with strategic recommendations

### Pattern 2: CEO-COS Strategic Communication

#### Real-time Strategic Consultation
- CEO poses business questions or strategic challenges
- COS provides executive-level analysis and recommendations
- Strategic priority setting and resource allocation guidance
- Business opportunity evaluation and competitive analysis

#### Multi-Business Evaluation
- CEO presents multiple business ideas for evaluation
- COS analyzes each opportunity and provides strategic comparison
- Recommendation with rationale and resource requirements
- Selected business idea moves to full orchestrated analysis

### Pattern 3: Sequential Workflow Execution (Future)

For complex business planning requiring multiple iterations:
1. **COS Initial Analysis** → Strategic framework and priorities
2. **Parallel Specialist Work** → Domain-specific planning and task creation
3. **COS Integration Review** → Cross-functional alignment and optimization
4. **Specialist Refinement** → Adjusted plans based on integration feedback
5. **Final COS Synthesis** → Comprehensive business plan and execution roadmap

## Resource Allocation Framework

| Agent | Budget % | Focus Area | Task Types | Timeline |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|----------|
| CTO   | 35%      | Technology | Development, Infrastructure, Security | 6 months |
| CMO   | 25%      | Marketing  | Brand, Content, Customer Acquisition | 4 months |
| CFO   | N/A      | Finance    | Modeling, Funding, Compliance | 3 months |
| COO   | 20%      | Operations | Processes, Team, Vendor Management | 5 months |
| Reserve | 20%   | Contingency | Risk mitigation, unforeseen costs | Ongoing |

## Cross-functional Coordination Matrix

```typescript
coordinationMatrix: [
  {
    fromAgent: 'CTO',
    toAgent: 'CMO', 
    dependency: 'Product features and capabilities for marketing positioning',
    timeline: 'Week 2-3 of development planning'
  },
  {
    fromAgent: 'CTO',
    toAgent: 'CFO',
    dependency: 'Development cost estimates and infrastructure costs',
    timeline: 'Week 1 of technology planning'
  },
  {
    fromAgent: 'CMO',
    toAgent: 'CFO',
    dependency: 'Customer acquisition cost projections and pricing input',
    timeline: 'Week 2 of marketing strategy development'
  },
  {
    fromAgent: 'CFO',
    toAgent: 'COO',
    dependency: 'Budget allocation for operations and team building',
    timeline: 'Week 1 of financial planning'
  },
  {
    fromAgent: 'COO',
    toAgent: 'CTO',
    dependency: 'Operational requirements for technical infrastructure',
    timeline: 'Week 1 of operations planning'
  }
]
```

## Memory and Context Management

### COS Agent Memory Strategy
- **Extended Context**: 100-message memory for strategic continuity
- **Persistent Storage**: LibSQL database for long-term business planning
- **Context Types**: Strategic decisions, delegation history, business analysis results
- **Memory Retrieval**: Recent conversations, semantic similarity for related business contexts

### Specialized Agent Memory (Future Implementation)
- **Domain-Specific Context**: 30-message memory optimized for specialist work
- **Shared Context**: Access to relevant COS delegation and business context
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Shared dependency information and timeline awareness

## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Configuration Pattern
```typescript
export const cosAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Chief of Staff',
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20'),
  tools: {
    'generate-okrs': okrGenerationTool,        // Strategic OKR creation
    'create-delegation-plan': delegationTool   // Specialist coordination
