# C-Suite Agent Architecture Design

## Overview

The aiCEO system implements a hierarchical agent architecture with the Chief of Staff (COS) agent serving as the central orchestrator for a specialized C-suite team. This design leverages Mastra's agent framework patterns for coordination, memory management, and tool calling.

## Agent Hierarchy & Roles

### Chief of Staff (COS) - Central Orchestrator
**Primary Functions:**
- Receives business ideas and translates them into strategic action plans
- Coordinates with specialized agents (CTO, CMO, CFO, COO)
- Synthesizes multi-agent analyses into comprehensive business plans
- Generates actionable task lists with clear priorities and dependencies
- Creates OKRs and identifies KPIs for tracking success
- Provides direct communication interface with CEO

**Agent Configuration Pattern:**
```typescript
export const cosAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Chief of Staff',
  model: google('gemini-1.5-pro-latest'),
  instructions: `[Executive-level strategic coordination instructions]`,
  tools: { taskGenerationTool, okrGenerationTool },
  memory: new Memory({
    storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: 'file:../cos-memory.db' }),
    maxMessages: 100 // Extended context for strategic continuity
  })
})
```

### Specialized Domain Agents

#### Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
- **Domain**: Technology strategy, development planning, infrastructure
- **Focus**: Technical feasibility, architecture decisions, development timelines
- **Task Categories**: Development setup, technology research, infrastructure planning
- **Memory Context**: 30 messages (technical decision history)

#### Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)
- **Domain**: Brand strategy, market positioning, customer acquisition
- **Focus**: Market analysis, brand development, marketing channel strategy
- **Task Categories**: Brand development, market research, content creation, customer outreach
- **Memory Context**: 30 messages (brand and market insights)

#### Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
- **Domain**: Financial strategy, funding, budget management
- **Focus**: Financial modeling, investor relations, cost optimization
- **Task Categories**: Financial planning, investor outreach, compliance setup
- **Memory Context**: 30 messages (financial decision context)

#### Chief Operating Officer (COO)
- **Domain**: Operations, processes, team building
- **Focus**: Operational efficiency, team structure, vendor management
- **Task Categories**: Process design, hiring, vendor relations, performance tracking
- **Memory Context**: 30 messages (operational decisions)

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### 1. Orchestrated Analysis Pattern
```
CEO Input → COS Analysis → Parallel Agent Consultation → COS Synthesis → Executive Output
```

**Flow:**
1. COS receives business idea and creates initial strategic framework
2. COS dispatches specific analysis requests to domain agents in parallel
3. Domain agents provide specialized insights within their expertise
4. COS synthesizes all agent outputs into unified business plan
5. COS generates prioritized task list and strategic recommendations

### 2. Sequential Workflow Pattern
```
COS → CTO → CMO → CFO → COO → COS (Final Synthesis)
```

**Flow:**
1. COS creates strategic foundation
2. CTO validates technical feasibility and requirements
3. CMO builds on technical foundation for market strategy
4. CFO incorporates market strategy into financial planning
5. COO designs operations based on all previous analyses
6. COS creates final integrated plan

### 3. CEO-COS Communication Pattern
```
CEO ↔ COS (Real-time Chat) → Agent Delegation → Status Updates → Refined Plans
```

**Flow:**
- CEO communicates directly with COS for guidance and feedback
- COS delegates specific tasks to appropriate agents based on conversation
- COS provides real-time updates on agent progress and task completion
- CEO can refine requirements, leading to updated agent instructions

## Task Creation Framework

### Task Template Structure
Based on the `AgentTaskTemplate` interface, all agents follow this structure:

```typescript
interface StandardTaskOutput {
  title: string              // Clear, actionable task name
  description: string        // Detailed task description
  category: TaskCategory     // Predefined category for organization
  estimatedHours: number     // Realistic time estimate
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  requiredSkills: string[]   // Skills needed to complete task
  dependencies: string[]     // Other tasks that must be completed first
  deliverables: string[]     // Specific outputs expected
  successCriteria: string[]  // How to measure task completion
}
```

### Agent-Specific Task Categories

**CTO Tasks:**
- `setup`: Development environment, tools, infrastructure
- `research`: Technology evaluation, architecture planning
- `development`: Implementation, testing, deployment

**CMO Tasks:**
- `research`: Market analysis, competitive research
- `marketing`: Brand development, content creation, campaigns
- `setup`: Marketing tools, analytics, automation

**CFO Tasks:**
- `financial`: Financial modeling, projections, analysis
- `legal`: Business registration, contracts, compliance
- `setup`: Accounting systems, banking, investor tools

**COO Tasks:**
- `operations`: Process design, workflow optimization
- `setup`: Operational tools, systems, infrastructure
- `development`: Team building, training, performance systems

## Business Analysis Workflow Architecture

### Workflow Schema (Mastra Pattern)
```typescript
export const businessAnalysisWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: 'business-analysis-workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    businessIdea: z.string(),
    companyName: z.string().optional(),
    industry: z.string().optional(),
    budget: z.number().optional(),
    timeline: z.string().optional()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    businessAnalysis: z.object({
      // Complete BusinessAnalysis interface
    })
  })
})
```

### Step-by-Step Workflow Design

#### Step 1: COS Strategic Foundation
```typescript
const cosInitialAnalysis = createStep({
  id: 'cos-initial-analysis',
  description: 'COS creates strategic foundation and coordination plan',
  inputSchema: businessIdeaSchema,
  outputSchema: cosAnalysisSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    // COS agent analyzes business idea and creates strategic framework
    // Identifies which agents need to be consulted
    // Creates initial task prioritization framework
  }
})
```

#### Step 2: Parallel Domain Analysis
```typescript
const parallelDomainAnalysis = createStep({
  id: 'parallel-domain-analysis',
  description: 'All domain agents analyze business idea in parallel',
  inputSchema: cosAnalysisSchema,
  outputSchema: agentAnalysesSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    // Execute CTO, CMO, CFO, COO analyses in parallel
    // Each agent provides domain-specific insights and tasks
    // Return structured analysis from each agent
  }
})
```

#### Step 3: COS Synthesis & Integration
```typescript
const cosSynthesis = createStep({
  id: 'cos-synthesis',
  description: 'COS integrates all analyses into unified business plan',
  inputSchema: agentAnalysesSchema,
  outputSchema: businessAnalysisSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    // Synthesize all agent analyses
    // Create prioritized master task list
    // Generate OKRs and KPIs
    // Provide executive summary and next steps
  }
})
```

### Workflow Chain
```typescript
businessAnalysisWorkflow
  .then(cosInitialAnalysis)
  .then(parallelDomainAnalysis)
  .then(cosSynthesis)
```

## Agent Communication Protocols

### 1. Context Sharing
- **Shared Context**: Business idea, company information, previous analyses
