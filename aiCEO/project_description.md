# aiCEO: Democratizing Entrepreneurship with AI C-Suite Agents

## Vision
Transform anyone into a successful CEO by providing access to specialized AI-powered C-suite executives who collaborate to turn ideas into actionable business plans.

Aspiring entrepreneurs lack the executive expertise needed to systematically build sustainable businesses. Traditional business planning tools provide templates, not strategic intelligence.

3. **Specialists** generate domain-specific actionable tasks 
4. **COS** synthesizes integrated business execution plan

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Mastra AI agent orchestration platform
