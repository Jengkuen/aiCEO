# AI CEO Task Execution System

The AI CEO Task Execution System enables users to not only create comprehensive business plans but also execute the generated tasks through coordinated specialist agents. This system bridges the gap between planning and execution, providing a complete end-to-end business implementation platform.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **Complete Business Planning**
- Generate comprehensive business plans using the entire C-suite team
- Automatic task creation and storage in database
- Multi-agent coordination across CTO, CMO, CFO, and COO
- Strategic analysis with actionable implementation plans

### 2. **Task Execution Capabilities**
- **Individual Task Execution**: Execute specific tasks by ID
- **Batch Task Execution**: Execute multiple tasks efficiently with filtering
- **Specialist Coordination**: Direct coordination with relevant specialist agents
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time updates from 'ready' to 'in_progress' to 'completed'

### 3. **Demo & Production Modes**
- **Demo Mode (default)**: Tasks complete immediately with realistic mocked results
- **Production Mode**: Tasks are marked as in-progress for real implementation
- Both modes provide authentic specialist agent coordination

## üìã Task Management Workflow

### 1. Business Plan Creation
```javascript
// User request: "Create a business plan for a sustainable food delivery service"
const result = await mastra.agent('cosAgent').generate(
  'Create a comprehensive business plan for a sustainable food delivery service in San Francisco'
);
```

### 2. Task Query and Review
```javascript
// User request: "Show me the tasks that were created"
const tasks = await mastra.agent('cosAgent').generate(
  'Show me all tasks for the sustainable food delivery service. What\'s ready to execute?'
);
```

### 3. Task Execution
```javascript
// User request: "Start executing the high-priority tasks"
const execution = await mastra.agent('cosAgent').generate(
  'Execute the top 3 high-priority tasks for the food delivery service'
);
```

### 4. Progress Tracking
```javascript
// User request: "What's the current status?"
const status = await mastra.agent('cosAgent').generate(
  'Show me the current status of all tasks. How many are completed?'
);
```

## üéØ Execution Examples

### Execute Individual Task
```javascript
await mastra.agent('cosAgent').generate(
  'Execute task "TECH_001" for the food delivery service'
);
```

### Execute by Specialist
```javascript
await mastra.agent('cosAgent').generate(
  'Execute all ready CTO tasks for the food delivery service'
);
```

### Execute by Priority
```javascript
await mastra.agent('cosAgent').generate(
  'Execute all high-priority tasks for the food delivery service'
);
```

### Batch Execution with Limits
```javascript
await mastra.agent('cosAgent').generate(
  'Execute up to 5 ready tasks for the food delivery service, prioritizing marketing tasks'
);
```

## üèó System Architecture

### Task Storage
- **Storage Backend**: JSON file-based simple task storage
- **Task Schema**: ID, title, specialist, priority, status, dependencies, deliverables
- **Status Tracking**: ready ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed
- **Filtering**: By business idea, specialist, priority, status

### Agent Coordination
- **COS Agent**: Central orchestrator with task execution capabilities
- **Specialist Agents**: CTO, CMO, CFO, COO with domain expertise
- **Mock Results**: Realistic simulation of specialist work output
- **Status Updates**: Automatic task status management

### Execution Modes

#### Demo Mode (Default)
```javascript
{
  simulate_completion: true  // Tasks complete immediately
}
```
- Tasks marked as 'completed' instantly
- Realistic mocked results from specialist agents
- Perfect for demonstrations and testing

#### Production Mode
```javascript
{
  simulate_completion: false  // Tasks marked as in-progress
}
```
- Tasks marked as 'in_progress'
- Requires manual status updates for completion
- Suitable for real implementation tracking
