Please explain your role as Chief of Staff and demonstrate your delegation approach:

1. How do you differ from a task-generating agent?
2. Show your strategic analysis process for an EdTech business
3. Create OKRs and delegation plans without creating operational tasks
4. Explain how specialists will receive context for task creation

Business Example: AI-powered personalized tutoring platform for high school students preparing for college admissions.
