# Step 1.3 Implementation Summary: Agent Architecture Design

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Comprehensive Type System (`src/types/index.ts`)
- **Core Business Types**: Company, Task, OKR, KeyResult, KPI, ChatMessage
- **Agent System Types**: AgentType, AgentAnalysis, BusinessAnalysis
- **Workflow Coordination Types**: AgentWorkflowInput, AgentTaskTemplate
- **Domain-Specific Types**: MarketAnalysis, TechnicalRequirements, FinancialProjections, OperationalPlan

### 2. Agent Architecture Documentation (`AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- **Hierarchical Design**: COS as central orchestrator with specialized domain agents
- **Interaction Patterns**: Three key patterns (Orchestrated Analysis, Sequential Workflow, CEO-COS Communication)
- **Task Creation Framework**: Standardized templates ensuring consistent task generation
- **Workflow Architecture**: Mastra-based step-by-step business analysis workflow
- **Memory & Context Management**: Strategic approach to agent memory and cross-agent coordination
- **Integration & Scalability**: Clear paths for frontend integration and system expansion

### 3. Task Creation Templates (`src/templates/task-templates.ts`)
- **Agent-Specific Templates**: Comprehensive task templates for CTO, CMO, CFO, COO, and COS
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Dynamic task creation based on business stage and requirements
- **Standardized Structure**: Consistent task format with deliverables, success criteria, and dependencies
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for agent-specific template retrieval and contextual task generation

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Agent Hierarchy
```
CEO (Human)
    ↓
Chief of Staff (COS) - Central Orchestrator
    ↓
├── CTO (Technology Strategy)
├── CMO (Marketing Strategy)  
├── CFO (Financial Strategy)
└── COO (Operations Strategy)
```

### Agent Specializations

#### Chief of Staff (COS)
- **Role**: Strategic coordination, executive communication, synthesis
- **Memory**: 100 messages for strategic continuity
- **Tools**: Task generation, OKR creation, executive dashboard setup

#### Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
- **Focus**: Technology research, development setup, infrastructure planning
- **Task Categories**: Setup, Research, Development
- **Key Templates**: Technology stack research, environment setup, infrastructure planning

#### Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)
- **Focus**: Market analysis, brand development, digital marketing
- **Task Categories**: Research, Marketing, Setup
- **Key Templates**: Competitive analysis, brand identity, digital marketing setup

#### Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
- **Focus**: Financial modeling, business setup, funding strategy
- **Task Categories**: Financial, Legal, Setup
- **Key Templates**: Financial model creation, entity formation, funding strategy

#### Chief Operating Officer (COO)
- **Focus**: Process design, team building, vendor management
- **Task Categories**: Operations, Development, Setup
- **Key Templates**: Process design, organizational structure, vendor management

### Workflow Patterns

#### Business Analysis Workflow
1. **COS Initial Analysis**: Strategic foundation and coordination plan
2. **Parallel Domain Analysis**: All specialists analyze simultaneously
3. **COS Synthesis**: Integration into unified business plan with prioritized tasks

#### Task Generation Framework
- **Structured Templates**: Each task includes title, description, category, estimated hours, priority, required skills, dependencies, deliverables, and success criteria
- **Context Awareness**: Tasks adapt based on business stage (idea → analysis → planning → execution)
- **Cross-Agent Dependencies**: Tasks from different agents properly reference each other

## Integration with Mastra Framework

### Agent Configuration Pattern
```typescript
export const [agentName]Agent = new Agent({
  name: '[Agent Title]',
  model: google('gemini-1.5-pro-latest'),
  instructions: `[Domain-specific strategic instructions]`,
  tools: { [domain-specific tools] },
  memory: new Memory({
    storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: 'file:../[agent]-memory.db' }),
    maxMessages: [appropriate context size]
  })
})
```

### Workflow Step Pattern
```typescript
const [stepName] = createStep({
  id: '[step-identifier]',
  description: '[step description]',
  inputSchema: [zodSchema],
  outputSchema: [zodSchema],
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    // Agent execution logic
    // Return structured analysis
  }
})
```

## Next Steps Preparation

This architecture design provides the foundation for:

### Hour 2: COS Agent Implementation
- Clear instructions and role definition
- Task generation tool integration
- Memory configuration for strategic continuity

### Hour 3: Specialized Agent Development
- Consistent agent patterns for rapid development
- Domain-specific instructions and tools
- Standardized memory management

### Hour 4: Business Analysis Workflow
- Well-defined workflow steps and data flow
- Structured input/output schemas
- Agent coordination patterns

### Hour 5: Dashboard Integration
- Type-safe API integration points
- Real-time agent communication protocols
- Task management and OKR tracking interfaces

## Architecture Strengths

1. **Mastra-Native Design**: Leverages Mastra's agent, workflow, and memory systems
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types ensure data integrity
3. **Scalability**: Modular design supports easy addition of new agents
4. **Executive Focus**: Task generation optimized for CEO-level strategic planning
5. **Consistency**: Standardized templates ensure quality across all agent outputs
6. **Integration Ready**: Clear API patterns for frontend dashboard integration

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Agent Response Quality**: Detailed instructions and structured templates
2. **Data Consistency**: Zod schemas for validation throughout workflow
3. **Memory Management**: Appropriate context sizes for each agent type
4. **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Clear dependency management and shared context

This foundation enables rapid implementation of the remaining development phases while ensuring professional-grade agent behavior and executive-focused task generation.
